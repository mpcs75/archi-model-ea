    documentation="A record of a clinical assessment performed to determine what problem(s) may affect the patient and before planning the treatments or management strategies that are best to manage a patient's condition. Assessments are often 1:1 with a clinical consultation / encounter, but this varies greatly depending on the clinical workflow. This resource is called &quot;ClinicalImpression&quot; rather than &quot;ClinicalAssessment&quot; to avoid confusion with the recording of assessment tools such as Apgar score.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;https://hl7.org/fhir/R4/clinicalimpression.html">
